Synchronization scripts for linux configration files

## Preparation
To use conf-sync you need a private git Repositpory. For instance, you can host the a private fork on GitHub.
To create a private GitHub fork use https://import.github.com/new. As base repository use the URL of this project (https://github.com/conf-sync/conf-sync).

## Installation
To create a local installation run:
```sh
curl http://git.io/vcNms -o install-conf-sync.sh 
bash install-conf-sync.sh
```
Note, Git.io is used for more convenience, the original url is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conf-sync/conf-sync/master/install.sh.
